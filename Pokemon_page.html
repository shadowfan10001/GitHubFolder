<body>
<p>pokemon x and y has to be the best in the series being the first 3d pokemon adventure with high quality battles and new pokemon and the newest type being fairy which is strong against a lot of types like dragon, dark,  and bug. but it can not hurt pokemon that much like fire, steel, and poison. in the kalos region there about 70 new kinds of pokemon that have been officially revealed in game and CoroCoro. and for those fans of starters if you were able to get a copy of x and/or y when it first came out you would have about 4 staters the first is a kalos starter next is one of the kanto starters and the third stater you get after you beat the pokemon league you can trade any pokemon for another kalos starter but depends on the starter you pick for your first one and the last one was a hidden ability torchic that has its mega stone with you could get from the mystery gift which is already over. The new mega evolution that features a lot for old pokemon like the kanto starters and blaziken.</p>
